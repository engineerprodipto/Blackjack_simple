# Blackjack_simple
This is a simple BlackJack game.
I made this game as my 2nd Milestone Project while doing the course "2021 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" by Jose Portilla.
I had fun creating this project as I have used OOP here in a project for the first time.
I took help from their workbook, which is nothing but a Jupyter Notebook with hints and tips about what funtions to create and how to arrange them.
